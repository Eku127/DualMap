**DualMap** is an online open-vocabulary mapping system that enables robots to understand and navigate dynamic 3D environments using natural language.

The system supports multiple input sources, including offline datasets (**Dataset Mode**), ROS streams & rosbag files (**ROS Mode**), and iPhone video streams(**Record3d Mode**). We provide examples for each input type.

## Updates
**[2025.06]** We released the Offline Query Examples â€” check it out [here](#offline-map-query)

## Installation

> âœ… Tested on **Ubuntu 22.04** with **ROS 2 Humble** and **Python 3.10**

### 1. Clone the Repository (with submodules)

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:Eku127/DualMap.git
cd DualMap
```
>  Make sure to use `--recurse-submodules` to get `mobileclip`.

### 2. Create Conda Environment
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate dualmap
```

### 3. Install MobileCLIP
```bash
cd 3rdparty/mobileclip
pip install -e . --no-deps
cd ../..
```

### (Optional) Setup ROS 2 Environment
Setting up ROS2 environment for ROS support and applications.
We recommend [ROS 2 Humble](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation.html).
Once installed, activate the environment:

```bash
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
```

> DualMapâ€™s navigation functionality and real-world integration are based on ROS 2. Installation is strongly recommended.

> **ROS1 noetic** is also supported, you can setup the ROS 1 by follow [this guide](resources/doc/ros_communication.md).

### (Optional) Setup Habitat Data Collector

<p align="center">
  <img src="resources/image/collector.jpg" width="70%">
</p>


[Habitat Data Collector](https://github.com/Eku127/habitat-data-collector) is a tool built on top of the [Habitat-sim](https://github.com/facebookresearch/habitat-sim). It supports agent control, object manipulation, dataset and ROS bag recording, as well as navigation through external ROS topics. DualMap subscribes to live ROS topics from the collector for real-time mapping and language-guided querying, and publishes navigation trajectories for the agent to follow.

> For the best DualMap experience (especially navigation tests), **we strongly recommend setting up the Habitat Data Collector**. See [the repo](https://github.com/Eku127/habitat-data-collector) for installation and usage details.


## Dataset

### Replica & ScanNet

Please follow [this guide](resources/doc/data_replica_scannet.md) to download and arrange the public Replica and ScanNet datasets for use with DualMap.


### HM3D Self-collected Data

We manually collected data in three HM3D scenes to support static and dynamic object navigation. Please follow [this guide](resources/doc/data_hm3d_self_collected.md) to download and arrange the self-collected HM3D data. 

### Dataset Structure
We recommend placing the data in the `dataset` folder within this repository.
The final `dataset` structure should look like this:
```
dataset/
â”œâ”€â”€ Replica/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ office0/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ results/              # RGB-D frames (depth + RGB)
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ traj.txt              # Trajectory file

## Applications

### Run with Datasets [TBD]
_Coming soon: Reproduce offline mapping results with Replica, ScanNet and self collected datasets._


### Run with ROS [TBD]
<p align="center">

</p>

_Coming soon: Online mapping and navigation via live ROS topics from the Habitat Data Collector and real world robot. Both ROS1 and ROS2 are supported_

#### ROS1 Support
This system can also work with **ROS1 Noetic** by using the `ros1_bridge`.

To set up the bridge between **ROS1 Noetic** and **ROS2 Humble** on **Ubuntu 22.04**, follow the instructions in [this guide](resources/doc/ros_communication.md). All commands have been tested and confirmed to work.

### Run with iPhone [TBD]
<p align="center">

_Coming soon: Real-time data streaming from Record3D to DualMap with open vocabulary semantic mapping._

### Offline Map Query
<p align="center">
  <a href="resources/doc/app_offline_query.md">

  </a>
</p>

We provide two prebuilt map examples for offline querying: one from iPhone data and one from Replica Room 0.

ðŸ‘‰ Follow [this guide](resources/doc/app_offline_query.md) to run the query application.

### Visualization
